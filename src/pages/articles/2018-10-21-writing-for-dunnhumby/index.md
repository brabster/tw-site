[Dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com) is a retail data science company that I've been working with lately.
I've enjoyed writing a couple of articles for their [Data Science and Engineering blog](https://medium.com/dunnhumby-data-science-engineering).

The first is a slightly extended version of an articles on here, [Scala Types in Scio Pipelines](https://medium.com/dunnhumby-data-science-engineering/scala-types-in-scio-pipelines-973a499f1db2).

The more recent article is original and talks about the experiences we've had putting together streaming demos of real-time streaming data processing solutions.
If you're interested, you can find that article at
[Building Live Streaming Demos](https://medium.com/dunnhumby-data-science-engineering/building-live-streaming-demos-ece9515efc4d)

Thanks to Dunnhumby for the opportunity to write on their blog!
