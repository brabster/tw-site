Having worked with analytics, marketing, machine learning, as well as my core of software development,
Iâ€™m flexible enough to help you.

I perform contract, consulting or freelance engagements that help you and challenge me.
My experience extends to leading small teams, technical architecture, strategic and tactical decision-making,
so whilst I'm primarily a hands-on software developer and data engineer I'm happy taking on broader roles.

## Current Engagement

I'm engaged with a client until November 9th, 2018.

## Experience

- Data engineering research and development with [Dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com/) (current)
- Software Developer with Real Looker Ltd.
- Principal Data Engineer with Sky Betting and Gaming

More detail is available on [my CV](PaulBrabbanCV.pdf).
