Having worked with analytics, marketing, machine learning, as well as my core of software development,
Iâ€™m flexible enough to help you.

I perform contract, consulting or freelance engagements that help you and challenge me.
My experience extends to leading teams, technical architecture and product development.
Whilst I'm primarily a hands-on software developer and data engineer I'm happy taking on broader roles.

Contact me to discuss an engagement at [paul@tempered.works](mailto:paul@tempered.works).
